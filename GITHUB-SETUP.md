# üöÄ GitHub Repository Setup Guide

## Quick Start Commands

### 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `lung-disease-diagnosis-ai` 
3. Description: "ü©ª AI-powered lung disease diagnosis from X-ray images using Next.js and TensorFlow.js"
4. Set to **Public** (or Private if preferred)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we have our own)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub
```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lung-disease-diagnosis-ai.git

# Verify remote connection
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Verify Upload
‚úÖ Check your GitHub repository contains:
- Complete project structure
- README.md displaying properly
- All source code files
- Documentation in /docs folder

## üåê Vercel Deployment (After GitHub Push)

### 1. Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. **Import Git Repository**
3. Select your `lung-disease-diagnosis-ai` repository
4. Click **"Deploy"** with default settings
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build completion

### 2. Get Your Live URL
- Production URL: `https://lung-disease-diagnosis-ai.vercel.app`
- Custom domain can be added later in Vercel dashboard

### 3. Test Live Application
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# Expected response:
{"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "version": "1.0.0"}
```
